# cs372proj2 ~ UAF CS 372 Project 2 (C++ to PostScript)

This is a repository intended to implement a library named CPS, which allows for high level abstractions of PostScript shape drawing.
CPS consists of:
- A shape language.
- A shape to PostScript translator.

# Tasks

- [ ] Circle.
- [ ] Polygon.
- [ ] Rectangle.
- [ ] Spacer.
- [ ] Square == Polygon 4.
- [ ] Triangle == Polygon 3.
- [ ] Rotate.
- [ ] Scale.
- [ ] Layer.
- [ ] Vertical.
- [ ] Horizontal

# Big Tasks As Mentioned in BlackBoard

- Formalize the shape language as one or more recursive type definitions.
- Design and implement CPS.
- Design one or more nice shapes of your own and generate PostScript from them. You'll probably want to write some classes that build on the shape language. For example, you might implement a class Skylines that contains methods returning randomized skylines with the number/height/shape of buildings specified as input arguments to the methods. Or you might implement a class Fractals that creates some fractal figures with a recursion limit specified by the user. These are just examples; it's entirely up to you. A prize will be awarded for the best shape.
- Design and implement a test strategy for this project. In addition to the test cases themselves, you should give a brief commentary explaining your strategy.
- Critique the specification of the shape language. Is the language expressive enough to create interesting drawings? Are the shape abstractions well-designed, or not? Do they make certain drawings easy/difficult to create? If you were to design the shape language from scratch, what would you do differently?
